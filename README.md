# hbhi-dhs

The scripts in this repo can be used to analyze the DHS to generate parasite prevalence estimates and intervention coverage for Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Scripts for our research on the the determinants of parasite prevalence in urban-rural areas in Nigeria, and for processing simulation inputs and outputs in the Nigeria model are also included. The Nigeria repo is most recently organized and contains 3 folders: 

[DHS-specific scripts](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-dhs/tree/master/Nigeria/DHS)

[Urban-rural specific scripts](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-dhs/tree/master/Nigeria/Research)

[simulation inputs and output analysis scripts](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-dhs/tree/master/Nigeria/simulation)
